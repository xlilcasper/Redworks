!!!UNTIL GITHUB STOPS ACTING BUGGY IM HOSTING REDWORKS 1.20 and REDWORKS 1.20 FLOPPY VERSION ON MF!!!

MAIN VERSION -->>http://www.mediafire.com/?uj17fb68clcdsy9
FLOPPY VERSION -->> http://www.mediafire.com/?ddk3sjg8hx1kdr2

FLOPPY version will allow you to have Redworks on just one terminal, good for SMP 
if an OP doesnt want all computers with Redworks or if you would like to use 
multiple OS's that may conflict with Redworks.

We are also writing a program now 'getredworks' when ran will download redworks on that specific terminal :)

----Installation. 
Go to the download tab and get the latest zip.
Extract the file. 
You should have a rom folder. 
Place that into your .minecraft/mods/computercraft/lua
Do not remove the original rom folder, all you are doing is merging our rom folder with the original rom folder
Overwrite should prompt for a help(s) file and startup file.
Say yes and continue. 
Have fun.
